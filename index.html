                <h5>Nigeria’s health outcome Indicators are still unacceptably high, in spite modest improvements. Maternal mortality ratio is 512 per 100 000. Mortality rate for infants and children under five years is 39 and 132 per 1000 live births respectively. Latest estimates show the prevalence of HIV/AIDS in the 15-64 age groups at 1.4 percent and in the under-15 age group at 0.2 percent. The total number of people living with HIV (PLHIV) in Nigeria is approximately 1.76 million, which is among the highest of any country in the world. Transmission of HIV/AIDS in Nigeria occurs primarily by sexual contact which accounts for 80 percent of person-to-person infection. 
                  A significant disparity in health status and distribution of qualified human resource for health exists across States & geopolitical zones as well as across rural/urban divide, education & social status. National performance shows clearly that Nigeria is making slow progress and health outcomes are worse in northern Nigeria. Only 18% of births in the North West are attended by a skilled provider. Similarly, immunization rates in the North-east and North-west are very low, with vaccination coverage among children age 12-23 months is lowest in Sokoto (5%). 
                  </h5>
                <h4>Poverty, Socio-economic development and Decent Work</h4>
                <h5>More than half of the Nigerian population (63.6%) live in the rural setting (MICS 5, 2018) with only 6% categorized as the wealthiest households in these areas (NDHS 2018). Some challenges that contribute to household poverty include limited access of rural areas to cheap and affordable financing services and poor financial and managerial knowledge to successfully invest resources, resulting in financial exclusion. 
                  Furthermore, the Bureau of Statistics put the current youth unemployment rate at 23.1 per cent and the total number of people classified as unemployed, which means they did nothing at all or worked too few hours (under 20 hours a week) to be classified as employed increased from 17.6 million in Q4 2017 to 20.9 million in Q3 2018. Although youth unemployment is not a recent phenomenon in Nigeria, it has become more worrisome because of the continued upward spiraling of youth unemployment which has been a significant contributor to the dramatic rise in social unrest and crime e.g. Boko-haram - (North East), militancy (Niger-delta), kidnapping (South-south), Cattle rustling (North-central).
                  </h5>
                <h4>Protection</h4>
                <h5>Vulnerable groups especially children and women often face immense obstacles that impact their ability to access and receive quality health and social services. In Nigeria, there is poor coordination to ensure that measures and structures to prevent and respond to abuse, neglect, exploitation and violence affecting children and women are put in place.
                  <li>Women: Among women age 15-49, (31%) have experienced physical violence. More than half of women (55%) who have experienced physical or sexual violence have never sought help to stop the violence. (NDHS 2018)</li>
                  <li>Children: 43% of children under age 5 have their births registered with the civil authorities; among these 62% are registered with NPC. (NDHS 2018)</li>
                </h5>
                <h4>Organizational Effective</h4>
                <h5>Over the years, various local and indigenous individual and Network of Non-Governmental Organizations have contributed positively to ensuring health and social services reach the target beneficiaries especially the marginalized, vulnerable groups and/or subpopulation.  However,
                  The performance of institutions and organizations has become a big problem in Nigeria. Many organizations perform poorly as a result of several interlocking factors including lack of understanding of their mandate; lack of or poor strategy to operationalise policies, weaknesses in the agencies or organizations in terms of capacity, competence, capability, culture, creativity and control.
                  </h5>
                <h4>Technical Approach – SPA 2019 – 2021</h4>
                <h5>HTYF has developed and launched the implementation of a 3-year strategic plan of action (2019 – 2021) which is built upon the successes of the past organizational SP and will address the unmet needs as identified. The programs/activities of the SPA are designed to contribute to achieving the United Nations 2030 Sustainable Development Goals (1, 2,3,4,6, 8, 10, 11& 16) and the Nigerian Strategic Plans of Action for Health, Nutrition, OVC, Education and Agriculture.</h5> 
                  <h5>Furthermore, HTYF’s efforts will be geared towards ensuring effective Public Private Collaboration & Partnerships in mobilizing necessary human, material, and financial resources. This will ensure the stability and viability of HTYF as she continues to create positive impact for vulnerable groups, especially women, children & youths within households and communities in Nigeria. HTYF is committed to advancing the rights and protection of women girls and children as a central focus its interventions and will utilize available assessments/analysis and SOPs to intervene however necessary.</h5>
